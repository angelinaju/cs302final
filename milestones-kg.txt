Challenge 7 Report:
	For how late I ended up starting on this challenge I think it went quite well. I'm glad
	that it was a challenge as I feel a lot more comfortable with the project that we have 
	decided on as it is a completely different ball park compared to what I am used to with
	the web-development flow of backend -> middle layer -> frontend. Now I feel like I have
	a better grip of the terminologies being used obviously not perfect yet but much better
	than before. Honestly the aspect I had the hardest part with was trying to get the 
	gym and mujoco installations to work together, after that I feel like I followed the
	tutorial to set up the environment well and understood the steps that were happening.
