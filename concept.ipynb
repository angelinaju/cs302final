    "This code doesn't work! Please don't try to run it. This ipnyb is something I wrote because my current implementation in the context of the Spot Mini Mini repository does not work properly and I knew you needed something readable to grade. The majority of the code located in those files are NOT mine, but there was a major change I had to fix in order to get the simulation working. \n",
