Time Log
	03/26/2025 (1 hour in lab)
	beginning to implement reinforcement learning, namely Proximal Policy Optimization, as a basic skeleton

	03/31/2025 (30 min)
	downloaded virtual machine necessary to implement environment

	15:15 03/31/2025 (1 hour)
	team meeting to discuss more about tasks needed to efficiently progress through project

	04/04/2025 (1 hour)
	downloaded rest of necessary dependencies for implementation

	04/05/2025 (2 hours)
	started PPO tutorials to further understand reinforcement learning ideas
	put coding progress in jupyter notebook of python code to test compilation and take notes
	a lot of conflicting information so i didn't progress as much as i wanted in my implementation, but it compiles
	brainstormed any additional data structure we could build for our project


Rubric
	20 points - Train and optimize reinforcement learning (RL) script
	8 points - Build final environment for visualization using Omniverse with chosen robot model
	5 points - Install necessary dependencies and files needed for implementation
	3 points - Thoroughly understanding the concepts behind Proximal Policy Optimization and ROS2 Humble
	4 points - Communicating any additional ideas to implement needed data structure to further implement RL script
