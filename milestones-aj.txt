Time Log: 
    3/26/2025: 1.5 hrs
        - Downloaded prerequisites such as VM, Ubuntu
        - Wrote out an instructions file for basic download information as well as suggestions on where to go next

    3/30/2025: 1.5 hrs
        - Downloaded ROS Humble
        - Completed multiple ROS2 tutorials including turtlesim   

    3/31/2025: 3 hrs
        - Team meeting to discuss tasks at 4:00 to 5:00
        - Completing ROS2 Publisher/Subscriber tutorial


Rubric: 

    5 pts - Complete all installations for VM, Ubuntu, ROS2 Humble, NVIDIA Omniverse/Gym and related tutorials. 
    5 pts - Watch in-depth Proximal Policy Optimization and ROS2 Humble tutorials for context and code understanding.
    20 pts - Successfully train and optimize reinforcement learning script with Proximal Policy Optimization.
    4 pts - Visualize quadruped model in either Omniverse, Rviz, or related 3D visualizers.
    6 pts - Implement data structure in RL script.


This challenge was a little confusing as I was not entirely sure what to include within the rubric. Additionally, our team had a difficult time deciding how the tasks 
are supposed to be divided, as the majority of the tasks include some sort of pair programming and cannot easily be broken up into smaller tasks for people to handle.
However, I was able to successfully complete several ROS2 tutorials and I am still looking into setting up IsaacSim/Omniverse.
